# Paystream üí∏

## üö® Development Warning üö®
**CRITICAL: Paystream v0 is a Proof of Concept**
- **NOT PRODUCTION READY**
- Potential security vulnerabilities
- Experimental blockchain implementation
- Subject to significant architectural changes

## Technical Overview
Paystream is a decentralized, trustless payment streaming protocol built on the Solana blockchain, implementing advanced token distribution mechanisms through programmable financial streams.

## Architecture

### Stream Distribution Models
Paystream implements three mathematically-defined distribution curves:

#### 1. Linear Stream
```
Equation: y(t) = m * t + b
- m: Constant distribution rate
- b: Initial token allocation
- Provides uniform, time-proportional token release
```

#### 2. Cliff Stream
```
Piecewise Function: 
y(t) = {
  0,          for t ‚â§ t‚ÇÄ
  f(t),       for t > t‚ÇÄ
- t‚ÇÄ: Initial lockup period
- Prevents premature fund withdrawal
- Enables performance-based compensation
```

#### 3. Step-wise Stream
```
Equation: y(t) = k * n(t)
- k: Fixed periodic payment amount
- n(t): Elapsed time period counter
- Supports recurring payments (weekly/monthly)
```

### Technical Specifications
- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Programming Model**: On-chain Solana program
- **Token Handling**: Escrow-based secure transfers
- **Unique Identifier**: Hashed Stream-ID for each agreement

### Smart Contract Components
- `create_stream()`: Initializes new payment stream
- `update_stream()`: Modifies stream parameters
- `withdraw()`: Allows fund extraction per stream rules
- `cancel_stream()`: Terminates ongoing stream with refund mechanisms

### Security Primitives
- Cryptographic stream hashing
- Time-based access controls
- Immutable stream parameter validation
- Atomic transaction guarantees
